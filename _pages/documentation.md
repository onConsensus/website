# How to Upload Media on GitHub and Create an "Images" Folder

To include media such as images in your GitHub repository, follow these steps to create a folder named "Images" in the same repository as your Markdown file:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Your Repository
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
- Navigate to the repository where your Markdown file is located.

### 2. Create the "Images" Folder
- In the repository, click on the "Add file" button.
- Select "Create new file" from the dropdown menu.
- In the text field for the new file name, type `Images/image.jpg`. This will create a new folder named "Images" and a placeholder file within it.
- Click "Commit new file" to create the folder. The placeholder file can be deleted later once you've uploaded your images.

### 3. Upload Images to the "Images" Folder
- Click on the "Images" folder to open it.
- Click on the "Add file" button again and select "Upload files".
- Drag and drop your image files into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them from your computer.
- After selecting the files, click "Commit changes" to upload the images to the "Images" folder.

### 4. Reference Images in Your Markdown File
- See [Header to Your Markdown File](#3.1)

### Example
If you uploaded an image named `/images/example.jpg`, your Markdown file should include:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title: My article title
date: 2022-05-07 15:01:35 +0300
author: First Lastname
image: '/images/33.jpg'
tags: [category]
---
```

### Additional Tips

Here are some key points to remember:

1. **Creative Commons Images**:

## Revenue Model Breakdown

The revenue model for journalists on the online magazine will be based on several key metrics:

1. **Number of Returning Visitors**:
   - A good returning visitor rate is anything over 30%. This means that if you have 10,000 visitors, at least 3,000 should be returning visitors to indicate a healthy engagement rate.

2. **Number of New Visitors**:
   - New visitors typically represent a significant portion of your traffic. For example, if you have 10,000 visitors in a week, approximately 70% (or 7,000) might be new visitors, indicating effective outreach and marketing efforts.

3. **Geographic Location**:
   - The value of visitors varies by region. For instance, visitors from North America and Western Europe can be 1.5 to 2 times more valuable in terms of ad revenue and purchase power compared to visitors from other regions.

4. **Time Spent on the Article**:
   - A good average time spent on an article is around 2-3 minutes. If visitors are spending 5 minutes or more, it indicates highly engaging content. For instance, an article with an average read time of 5 minutes can be considered highly valuable.

5. **Quality of Referring Links**:
   - High-quality referring links typically come from websites with high domain authority (DA). A good benchmark is a DA score of 50 or higher. For example, a link from a site with a DA of 70 is significantly more valuable than one with a DA of 20.

6. **Outgoing Clicks**:
   - A good rate of outgoing clicks is around 5-10% of total visits. For example, if an article has 1,000 views, having 50 to 100 outgoing clicks indicates strong engagement with external links.

The magazine will take 50% of the total revenue generated. The remaining 50% will be distributed among the contributors: writers, photographers, and videographers.

# YouTube Revenue Distribution for Contributors

In addition to the article revenue distribution, the YouTube revenue generated from videos hosted on the VJs TV YouTube channel will be distributed among the magazine, videographer, and video journalist. Here is the detailed distribution model:

## Distribution Model

### Base Model
- **Magazine**: 30%
- **Remaining Revenue**: 70% (to be split among contributors)

### Scenario 1: Magazine, Videographer, and Video Journalist
- **Magazine**: 30%
- **Videographer**: 40%
- **Video Journalist**: 30%

### Scenario 2: Magazine and Videographer Only
- **Magazine**: 30%
- **Videographer**: 70%

### Scenario 3: Magazine and Video Journalist Only
- **Magazine**: 30%
- **Video Journalist**: 70%

## Example Calculation

For instance, if a video generates $1,000 in YouTube ad revenue:

- **Scenario 1**:
  - **Magazine**: $300
  - **Videographer**: $400
  - **Video Journalist**: $300

- **Scenario 2**:
  - **Magazine**: $300
  - **Videographer**: $700

- **Scenario 3**:
  - **Magazine**: $300
  - **Video Journalist**: $700

By maintaining the magazine's share at 30% across various scenarios, this model ensures the magazine's operational costs are covered while fairly compensating the content creators based on their roles.

# Payouts

Payouts will be made on a monthly basis, based on the total magazine revenue. Your total score, derived from various engagement metrics, will determine your share of the total revenue. Below is an example breakdown:

## Example Breakdown
- Total Monthly Revenue: $25,000
- 100 Authors (Articles)
- 20 Videographers (YouTube Videos)
- 50% of revenue allocated to articles: $12,500
- 30% of revenue allocated to YouTube videos: $7,500

### Revenue Breakdown Model

#### For Articles:
1. **Number of Returning Visitors**:
   - A good returning visitor rate is anything over 30%. For example, with 10,000 visitors, at least 3,000 should be returning visitors to indicate a healthy engagement rate.

2. **Number of New Visitors**:
   - New visitors typically represent a significant portion of your traffic. For example, if you have 10,000 visitors in a week, approximately 70% (or 7,000) might be new visitors, indicating effective outreach and marketing efforts.

3. **Geographic Location**:
   - The value of visitors varies by region. For instance, visitors from North America and Western Europe can be 1.5 to 2 times more valuable in terms of ad revenue and purchase power compared to visitors from other regions.

4. **Time Spent on the Article**:
   - A good average time spent on an article is around 2-3 minutes. If visitors are spending 5 minutes or more, it indicates highly engaging content. For instance, an article with an average read time of 5 minutes can be considered highly valuable.

5. **Quality of Referring Links**:
   - High-quality referring links typically come from websites with high domain authority (DA). A good benchmark is a DA score of 50 or higher. For example, a link from a site with a DA of 70 is significantly more valuable than one with a DA of 20.

6. **Outgoing Clicks**:
   - A good rate of outgoing clicks is around 5-10% of total visits. For example, if an article has 1,000 views, having 50 to 100 outgoing clicks indicates strong engagement with external links.

#### For YouTube Videos:
- Revenue is split among videographers based on similar engagement metrics adapted for video content.
- Example: From the $7,500 allocated to YouTube revenue, if a video contributes 10% of the total engagement, it would earn $750.

### Distribution:
- **Authors (Articles)**: Share of $12,500 based on engagement metrics.
- **Videographers (YouTube)**: Share of $7,500 based on YouTube metrics.

Payouts will be made via Revolut.
