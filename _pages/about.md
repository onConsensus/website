onConsensus was founded in 2022 by [Guillaume Lauzier](https://guillaumelauzier.com) out of a deep passion for decentralized technologies and the transformative potential they hold. As an online news platform, onConsensus is dedicated to exploring and promoting the latest developments in blockchain, cryptocurrency, DeFi, and cybersecurity. Our team is composed of tech experts, journalists, and enthusiasts who are driven by a shared interest in the intersection of technology, finance, and digital security. We aim to create a space where readers, innovators, and industry professionals can connect, exchange ideas, and stay informed about the rapidly evolving world of decentralized systems.

We have now implemented a contribution system using GitHub for writers, researchers, and content creators passionate about blockchain, cryptocurrency, decentralized finance (DeFi), and cybersecurity. This fair and transparent contribution system encourages anyone with expertise or interest in these fields to join the team and contribute. More information is available on our [documentation page](https://onconsensus.com/documentation/).

onConsensus is committed to empowering the community of blockchain developers, crypto investors, DeFi pioneers, and cybersecurity professionals. We aim to provide a trusted resource for anyone passionate about decentralized technologies through in-depth insights and a collaborative platform.
